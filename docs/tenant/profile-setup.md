# Setting Up Your Tenant Profile

Your tenant profile consists of five main sections:
1. **[Personal Information](personal-info.md)** - Contact details and identification
2. **[Employment Information](employment.md)** - Income and job details  
3. **[Rental History](rental-history.md)** - Previous rental experiences
4. **[Documents](documents.md)** - Required verification documents
5. **[Additional Information](additional-info.md)** - Pets, vehicles, and other details
